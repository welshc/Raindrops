Raindrops
=========

raindrops game

Press any key to start

Use arrow keys to make catcher move

create an array of presents and coal

catch falling presents and coal with catcher by having catcher recognize the images

each time present is caught, add 1 to score variable

when score reaches 10, you win

each time coal is caught, subtract 1 from score variable

when score reaches -5, you lose

When you win or lose, click play again

Note: click in between "play" and "again" to restart game 

Note: If after you win/lose (score=10 or score=-5) and you are on the play again screen and you catch another drop, score will be affected and game will continue. I tried to fix this a couple of different ways, but each time it changes something else and I couldn't get it back. I decided to just leave it. 

Note: To catch a present or coal, you have to be beneath it. Slightly to the side will not work.
